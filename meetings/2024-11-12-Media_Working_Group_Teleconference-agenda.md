* [w3c/webcodecs#839 Camera Effect Status: API](https://github.com/w3c/webcodecs/issues/839) - @brychanrobot, @markafoltz
> The proposal enables websites to detect which OS-level effects have been applied to a given video frame by reading the appropriate field on `VideoFrameMetadata`. It could have a number of applications, but we expect that it would primarily be used help prevent conflicts between operating system and web application camera effects.
