* [w3c/mediasession#264 Add new actions to support video conferencing websites](https://github.com/w3c/mediasession/issues/264) - steimelchrome
> In order to make the Media Session API more useful for video conferencing websites using WebRTC, we should add the following actions [...]

* [w3c/media-wg#28 Prepare new Media WG charter](https://github.com/w3c/media-wg/issues/28) - tidoust
> The [current Media WG charter](https://www.w3.org/2019/05/media-wg-charter.html) expires end of May 2021. For some reason, I thought we still had time to prepare a new charter. In practice, we need a new draft charter soon, ideally within the next couple of weeks, at worst end of March, so that we may run the rechartering process (horizontal reviews, review by W3C Management, and then review by W3C Members) before the charter expires (*).

* [w3c/media-wg#27 Synchronize /TR documents with Editor's Drafts](https://github.com/w3c/media-wg/issues/27) - tidoust
> As raised during [today's Media WG call](https://www.w3.org/2021/02/09-mediawg-minutes.html#t02), once a specification has been published to /TR, i.e. after publication of the spec as First Public Working Draft, the Editor's Draft can be kept in sync with the document in /TR automatically (through [Echidna](https://github.com/w3c/echidna/wiki)).

* [w3c/media-wg#24 Move WebCodecs to the Media WG](https://github.com/w3c/media-wg/issues/24) - mounirlamouri
> Quick update.

* [w3c/media-capabilities#165 Define MediaCapabilitiesDecodingInfo.codecSwitchingSupported](https://github.com/w3c/media-capabilities/pull/165) - chcunningham
> Interop feedback/discussion.
